# Introduction to Linux

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world’s smartphones are powered by Linux.

However, newcomers to Linux may find it somewhat difficult to approach, as Linux filesystems have a different structure than those found on Windows or MacOS. Additionally, Linux-based operating systems depend heavily on working with the command line interface, while most personal computers rely on graphical interfaces.





## The Terminal

The terms `terminal`, `shell`, and `command line interface` are often
 used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them:

- A *terminal* is an input and output environment that presents a text-only window running a shell.
- A *shell* is a program that exposes the computer’s operating 
  system to a user or program. In Linux systems, the shell presented in a 
  terminal is a command line interpreter.
- A *command line interface* is a user interface (managed by a 
  command line interpreter program) which processes commands to a computer
   program and outputs the results.



When someone refers to one of these three terms in the context of 
Linux, they generally mean a terminal environment where you can run 
commands and see the results printed out to the terminal, such as this:
